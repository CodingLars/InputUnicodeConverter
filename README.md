# Ascii Input to Unicode Converter
This was something that someone requested on Discord. 
It replaces the characters you type with Unicode look-a-likes. This makes the text harder to catch with a filter, for example for censoring.

Currently this program **can**:
- Detect what key is pressed.
- Delete that character and put in a hardcoded unicode character.
Currently this can **NOT**:
- Configure custom unicode characters.
- Convert numbers to unicode characters.
- Differentiate between lowercase and uppercase characters.
- Differentiate between shortcuts and normal keystrokes. (i.e. CTRL + A = Unicode a)

I am not sure if I will commit to this that much. So the inconveniences are *mostly* up to you to fix.
